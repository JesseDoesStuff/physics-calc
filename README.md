KINEMATICS CALCULATOR ---

USE THE LETTERS FOR EACH VALUE IN THE INPUTS. THE LETTERS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

D - DISPLACEMENT
T - TIME
V0 - INITIAL VELOCITY
VF - FINAL VELOCITY
A - ACCELERATION

THE CALCULATOR WILL FIND A VALUE AS LONG AS THERE IS AT LEAST THREE KNOWN KINEMATIC VALUES AND NOT ALL THE VALUES ARE DEFINED

LOVE YA
